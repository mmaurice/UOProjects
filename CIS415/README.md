# CIS415/Operating Systems

This course is an introduction to the theory and practice behind modern computer operating systems. Topics will include what an operating system does (and doesn't) do, system calls and interfaces, processes, concurrent programming, resource scheduling and management (e.g., CPU, memory, devices), virtual memory, deadlocks, distributed systems and networks, and security. We will approach the subject from both a theoretical perspective (what are the abstractions and algorithms?) as well as a practical one (what are the mechanisms and how are they built?).
