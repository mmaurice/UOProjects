# Master Control Program

In this assignment, we implemented a MCP whose job was to run and schedule a workload of other programs. The MCP read a list of programs to run from a file, start up the programs as processes, and then schedule the processes to run concurrently in a time-sliced manner. In addition, the MCP monitored the
processes and keep track of how the processes are using system resources.
