# Adjacency Matrix

This project takes in multple grapsh in list form, number of vertices followed by edge sets. The project reads this list and then converts it into an adjacency katrix with 1's on connected edges and 0's on disconnected edges. We then use that information to traverse the graph using bredth first search and output the number of vertices, edges, and more importantly longest path, shorest path and total number of paths.
