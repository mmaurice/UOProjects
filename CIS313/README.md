# CIS 313/Intermediate Data Structures

Design and analysis of data structures as means of engineering efficient software; attention to data abstraction and encapsulation. Lists, trees, heaps, stacks, queues, dictionaries, priority queues.

This is a collection of a few of the projects I worked in while in CIS 313.
