# AVL Tree

This porject implements a self balancing binary search tree. This is done by checking the heights of the child subtrees of any node, and if they differ by any more than one, then through a series of rotations around nodes the tree will rebalance itself. This is usful because search, insertion and deletion all take at most O(log n) time. Where the n is the number of nodes in the tree.
